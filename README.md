# Product-Data-Analysis_Thank-You-Calls
An analysis to evaluate the need for a "Thank You Call" Product Feature for an e-Commerce Application catered towards vacation stays.

The company sells flights and hotel stays through an automated process, where in just 2 texts, a customer can book their entire stay. The company has been experimenting with a bot calling customers after successfully completing their first stay to thank them for using its service. The goal of the analysis is to determine whether or not the calls provide any additional value based on a subset of customers whose first purchase was between 200-300 Canadian Dollars.
